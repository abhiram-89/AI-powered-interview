🤖 AI-Based Interview Platform
-------------------------------

An intelligent, end-to-end AI-powered interview platform built using React.js, Python (FastAPI), AutoGen, and MongoDB.
This platform automates the interview process by simulating real interviewers using AI agents, evaluating candidates dynamically, and generating structured feedback in real time.

📌 Project Overview
--------------------

The AI Interview Platform is designed to help organizations, recruiters, and individuals conduct automated technical and non-technical interviews without human intervention.

Using multi-agent AI systems, the platform can:

Ask adaptive interview questions

Analyze candidate responses

Generate follow-up questions

Provide structured interview evaluations

This system reduces interviewer workload, ensures consistency, and enables scalable hiring.

🎯 Purpose of the Project
---------------------------

Traditional interviews are:

Time-consuming

Hard to scale

Subjective and inconsistent

This project solves those problems by introducing:

AI-driven interviewers

Automated evaluation

Real-time interaction

Data-driven insights

It can be used for:

Technical hiring

Mock interviews

Skill assessments

Campus recruitment

Self-evaluation practice

🧠 How the Platform Works (High-Level Flow)
---------------------------------------------

Candidate logs into the platform

Selects interview type (role, skills, difficulty)

AI Interview Agent starts asking questions

Candidate submits responses

AI Evaluation Agent analyzes answers

Follow-up questions are generated dynamically

Final feedback and score are produced

Interview results are stored securely in the database
