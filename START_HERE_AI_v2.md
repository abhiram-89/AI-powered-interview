# 🚀 COMPLETE SETUP GUIDE - AI Interview Assistant v2.0

## System Ready to Launch!

Your AI Interview Assistant is now fully configured with:
- ✅ **Gemini AI Integration** (already configured in .env)
- ✅ **Dynamic Question Generation** (real-time via AI)
- ✅ **Intelligent Answer Analysis** (sentence structure, keywords, examples)
- ✅ **Answer Validation** (rejects vague/short answers)
- ✅ **MongoDB Database** (ai_interviews collection)
- ✅ **Real-time Feedback** ("Thank you" + AI analysis)

---

## 🎯 STEP 1: Start MongoDB (if not running)

### Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
# Check if MongoDB is running
mongosh

# If not running, start it (check your MongoDB installation)
# Usually: mongod --dbpath "C:\data\db"
```

**Verify:**
```
mongosh
> show databases
> use ai_interviews
> show collections
```

✓ Should see: `ai_interviews` database exists

---

## 🎯 STEP 2: Start Backend (AI Engine)

### Terminal 1:
```bash
cd c:\Users\ABHIRAM\Documents\ai-interview-assistant\backend

# Run the NEW v2.0 backend with Gemini AI
uvicorn main_v2:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
INFO:     ✓ Connected to MongoDB: mongodb://localhost:27017
INFO:     ✓ Gemini AI model initialized
```

✓ Visit: http://localhost:8000/docs (API documentation)

---

## 🎯 STEP 3: Start Frontend

### Terminal 2:
```bash
cd c:\Users\ABHIRAM\Documents\ai-interview-assistant

# Install dependencies (one time)
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

**Expected Output:**
```
> Ready in XXms
> Local:        http://localhost:3000
```

✓ Visit: http://localhost:3000

## 🔑 Key Features Explained

### 1. **Dynamic Question Generation**
```
✨ Gemini AI creates unique questions based on:
   • Role (Backend, Frontend, Data, DevOps, etc.)
   • Experience Level (Junior, Mid, Senior)
   • Skills (Python, React, etc.)
   • Previously asked topics (avoids repetition)

Example questions:
✓ "Design a scalable API for real-time data streams"
✓ "Explain your approach to state management in React"
✓ "How would you optimize a slow database query?"
```

### 2. **Intelligent Answer Analysis**
```
🧠 Gemini analyzes each answer on:
   
   1. SENTENCE FORMATION (1-10)
      → Is answer well-structured and clear?
   
   2. TECHNICAL ACCURACY (1-10)
      → Is technical content correct?
   
   3. KEYWORD USAGE (1-10)
      → Does it use appropriate terminology?
   
   4. EXAMPLES/SCENARIOS (1-10)
      → Are there real-world examples?
   
   5. DEPTH (1-10)
      → Does it show deep understanding?
   
   6. COMPLETENESS (1-10)
      → Does it fully address the question?

   📊 FINAL MARKS = Average of all 6 factors
```

### 3. **Answer Validation**
```
🛡️ Automatically rejects invalid answers:

   ❌ "yes" → Too vague
   ❌ "idk" → Not a genuine response
   ❌ "I don't know" → Lacks detail
   ❌ "ok" → Too brief
   ❌ Gibberish text → Not a real answer
   ❌ Single word answers → Insufficient detail

✅ Valid answers must be:
   • 30+ characters
   • Unique content (30%+ unique words)
   • Genuine technical response
```

### 4. **Real-Time Feedback Loop**
```
User submits answer
        ↓
1. Validation check (rejects invalid)
        ↓
2. Gemini analysis (if valid)
        ↓
3. Show "Thank you for response!"
        ↓
4. Display analysis + marks + feedback
        ↓
5. Auto-fetch next question
        ↓
User answers next question...
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Backend not responding"
```bash
# Check if backend is running on port 8000
# Restart backend:
cd backend
uvicorn main_v2:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Issue: "Gemini not responding"
```bash
# Check Gemini API key in backend/.env
# Verify it's: GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyAgiTBFGwEgVNcnrP4oZwwKSpSTuigCrvc
# If missing, add it manually to backend/.env
```

### Issue: "MongoDB connection error"
```bash
# Start MongoDB:
mongosh

# If that doesn't work:
# Find MongoDB installation and run: mongod --dbpath "C:\data\db"
```

### Issue: "Frontend shows 'Exit Code 1'"
```bash
cd c:\Users\ABHIRAM\Documents\ai-interview-assistant
rm -r .next node_modules
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Issue: "Questions are generic/static"
```
This means Gemini is not initialized.
Check:
1. GEMINI_API_KEY is set in backend/.env
2. Backend shows "✓ Gemini AI model initialized"
3. Restart backend if needed
```

### Issue: "Answers rejected as invalid"
```
This is correct behavior! Valid answers need:
✓ 30+ characters
✓ Not just "yes/no/ok/idk"
✓ Real technical content
✓ 30%+ unique words

Example GOOD answer:
"I would use a microservices architecture with 
Docker containers and Kubernetes for orchestration. 
For the database, I'd choose PostgreSQL for ACID 
compliance and Redis for caching..."
```

## 📈 Expected Results

### After 1 Question:
- Question appears (AI-generated, specific to role)
- You submit answer
- Instant feedback: marks (0-10), analysis

### After 8 Questions:
- Overall score calculated (0-100%)
- Recommendation given: "Strong Hire" / "Hire" / "Maybe" / "No Hire"
- Data saved to `ai_interviews.reports`

### Sample Report:
```json
{
  "interview_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
  "candidate_name": "John Doe",
  "overall_percentage": 78.5,
  "recommendation": "Hire",
  "total_questions": 8,
  "answers": [
    {
      "marks": 8,
      "percentage": 80,
      "correctness": "good",
      "feedback": "Well-structured answer with good technical depth"
    },
    // ... 7 more answers
  ]
}
```
